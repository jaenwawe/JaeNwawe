- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linguistics:
    I learned to speak Japense when I studied aboad there for 5 months.
    I learned to speak, read, and write Spanish proficiently.  During my year and a half in South America, I  studyed Linguistics at La Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile for nine months, exploring endless cultural events in Buenos Aires, Argentina for three months, and rewarded myself for studying linguistics in the Spanish Graduate Level program by studying salsa dancing in the salsa capitol of the world since salsa dancing is my passion.
